#0018 If an attempt is made to provide an answer to an already answered question the system shall respond with "I don't know about that. I was taught differently" and not update the question
#0019 The system shall provide a means of updating an answer to the previously asked question.
#0020 The system shall accept and store answers to previous questions in the form of a string or a function pointer and store it as the generator function.
#0021 If no previous question has been asked the system shall respond with "Please ask a question first".
